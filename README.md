# GUI Screenshot Adversarial Attack

This project implements a **targeted adversarial attack** on GUI screenshots using [EVA CLIP](https://github.com/BAAI-EVAL/EVA) models (e.g., E-14, E-14+).  
The goal is to make a screenshot semantically resemble a **target concept** (e.g., *‚Äúa dog wearing sunglasses‚Äù*) while still looking like a **benign GUI** (e.g., *a search page*).

---

## üì¶ Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Edit `config.py`** to configure your attack:

   ```python
   TARGET_TEXT = "a dog wearing sunglasses"             # Target concept to simulate
   CLEAN_TEXT = "a search page"                         # Description of original GUI

   IMAGE_PATH = "path_to_original_screenshot"           # Screenshot to be attacked
   REF_IMAGE_PATH = "path_to_reference_image"           # Image of the target concept
   ```

   - üîπ `REF_IMAGE_PATH` You can:
     - Use an image generated by a text-to-image model based on `TARGET_TEXT`, or
     - Provide your own manually selected image that visually matches the target.

---

## üöÄ Run the Attack

Launch the attack with:

```bash
python run_attack.py
```

This will:
- Load the appropriate EVA CLIP model
- Preprocess and normalize the image
- Run a PGD-style targeted attack
- Save the adversarial images

---

## üñºÔ∏è Output

Adversarial image will be saved to the working directory:

- **Adversarial image** (visually similar but semantically changed):  
  `adv_{clip_type}.jpeg` (same filename unless modified)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- You can switch between models by editing `CLIP_TYPE` in `config.py`:
  ```python
  CLIP_TYPE = "e14"       # or "e14plus"
  ```

- Images are automatically resized to `224 √ó 224` during preprocessing.
